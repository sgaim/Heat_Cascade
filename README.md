# Heat_Cascade
This program calculates basic temperatures and enthalpy for streams as well as the pinch. Using matplotlib the three composite curves will be graphed, unadjusted, shifted and grand. The only inputs necessary are the supply temps, target temps, minimum change in temperature, and heat capacity flowrate.
